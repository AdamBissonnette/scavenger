Scenario:
===================================
The TwiMLHandler receives a message

What do we do???
-----------------------------------
We check the message to see if we can find a registered User from the sending Phone number
If we can get a user then
    - We check to see which clue they're on
        If we find a clue then
            - We check to see if the answer they sent matches an Accepted Answer for that clue
                If the Answer is Accepted for that clue then
                    - We check that Answer to see which clue to send next
                        If we find a clue then
                            - We send that clue as a response
                        Else (No more clues, it's over or broken)
                            - We send a response that the hunt is over and there are no more clues
                Else (Check global commands then hints)
                    - We check to see if they sent a global command (e.g. Quit, Time, Help, etc...)
                        If we find a global command then
                            - We respond with the results of that command function
                        Else (Send em' Hints)
                            - We check to see if they have hints available for that clue
                                If there are hints available then
                                    - We send them the hint
                                Else (Things are too hard or they are bad?)
                                    - We recommend they skip and message admins to let them know the hunt is too hard
        Else (They haven't started yet)
            - We send them the first clue for the adventure
            
Else (I'm a TwiML handler and who the hell are you??)
    We respond saying that they haven't registered
